### 3.3.2 Process Termination Messsages

Whenever a user process terminates, because it called exit or for any other reason, print the process's name and exit code, formatted as if printed by printf ("%s: exit(%d)\n", ...);. The name printed should be the full name passed to process_execute(), omitting command-line arguments. Do not print these messages when a kernel thread that is not a user process terminates, or when the halt system call is invoked. The message is optional when a process fails to load.

Aside from this, don't print any other messages that Pintos as provided doesn't already print. You may find extra messages useful during debugging, but they will confuse the grading scripts and thus lower your score.
