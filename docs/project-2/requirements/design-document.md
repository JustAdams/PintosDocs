## 3.3.1 Design Document

In addition to submitting your source code, your group is responsible for explaining and defending your project's design to us.

You must submit a design document as a group through Canvas to the Project 2 Design and Documentation assignment. We recommend you read the the project 2 design document template before you start working on the project.
